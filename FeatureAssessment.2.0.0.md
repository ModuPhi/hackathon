# Feature Assessment – SPEC 2.0.0

## Objectives & Status
- **Dynamic journeys manifest & loader** (SPEC deliverables §server/client): ✅ Implemented `server/data/journeys.json`, `/api/journeys`, manifest-driven dashboard, and `JourneyLoader` with context injection/telemetry.
- **Journey run tracking** (SPEC deliverables §server/client): ✅ Added in-memory runs repo, REST endpoints (`GET/POST /api/journey-runs`), and telemetry wiring from loader/modules.
- **Completed counter & dashboard UX** (SPEC deliverables §client): ✅ Header badge now reads from journey runs; cards hydrate from manifest with auth/nonprofit gating.
- **Safeguards & docs** (SPEC deliverables §docs, SPEC risks): ✅ Enforced same-origin import validation plus manifest import whitelist, added `scripts/check-journey-imports.mjs`, authored `JOURNEYS_MANIFEST.md`.

## Work Performed
- Created manifest file (`server/data/journeys.json`) and accessor endpoints in `server/routes.ts`, including session header enforcement.
- Built `JourneyRunsRepo` (`server/journeys.ts`) supporting start/complete lifecycles; responses emit ISO timestamps.
- Added client hooks (`use-journeys`, `use-journey-runs`) to hydrate dashboard and badge, including auth-dependent fetch headers.
- Authored `JourneyLoader` with dynamic module registry (via `import.meta.glob`), same-origin guard, telemetry hooks, and error boundary fallback.
- Wrapped legacy overlays (`EffectAOverlay`, `EffectBOverlay`) into journey modules and added optional telemetry/capability props to existing components.
- Replaced legacy effects board with manifest-driven `JourneysBoard`, integrating authentication + nonprofit gating and manifest metadata.
- Updated header badge to pull completion count from `/api/journey-runs`.
- Added lint task (`npm run lint:journeys`) preventing forbidden imports; documented manifest usage in `JOURNEYS_MANIFEST.md`.

## Tests & Results
- `npm run check` (TypeScript) – ✅
- `npm test` (`vitest run`) – ✅
- `npm run lint:journeys` – ✅
- Manual sanity (browser) still pending confirmation from user after loader registry refactor.

## Repo Hygiene
- No changes to `AGENTS.md` (file absent).
- Added documentation file `JOURNEYS_MANIFEST.md` per SPEC docs requirement.

## Open Items / Risks
- Awaiting confirmation that updated loader resolves runtime import errors in the browser. If issues persist, inspect Vite dev cache and ensure full reload.
- In-memory run storage resets on server restart; acceptable per SPEC but note for future persistence work.
