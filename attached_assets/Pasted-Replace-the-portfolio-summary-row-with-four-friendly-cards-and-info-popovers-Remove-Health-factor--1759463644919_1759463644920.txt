Replace the portfolio summary row with four friendly cards and info popovers. Remove “Health factor” and “Debt” from the surface UI. Do not change any navigation or effect flows.

TITLE BAR
- Keep “DeFi Giving”, Mock Mode pill, Effects completed counter, bell icon, Demo User.

PORTFOLIO SUMMARY — ROW OF 4 CARDS
Create four equal cards in one horizontal row (responsive: stack to 2x2 on narrow screens). Each card shows a big number, a short caption, and an ⓘ icon that opens a small popover with 2–3 sentences of plain-English help. Numbers update immediately when an Effect completes. Subtle 200 ms fade/scale animation on number changes and popovers. Accessible: keyboard focus ring, popovers close with Esc and clicking outside.

Card 1 — Cash Available
- Label: “Cash Available”
- Caption: “Ready to allocate”
- Number: current liquid amount the user can use. Keep the existing demo starting value.
- ⓘ popover text:
  “This is the portion of your credits you have not used yet. You can start a new Effect or donate directly from here.”

Card 2 — Invested Assets
- Label: “Invested Assets”
- Caption: “Still growing”
- Number: current value of held tokens (APT or others) shown as a single USD value. If none, show 0.00.
- ⓘ popover text:
  “This is the value of the crypto you hold here. It may rise or fall with the market. You keep exposure while you learn.”

Card 3 — Commitments
- Label: “Commitments”
- Caption: “To be repaid later”
- Number: total borrowed amount outstanding. Hide the card until the user has any borrowed amount, or render the number as 0.00 with a lighter style before any loan exists.
- ⓘ popover text:
  “When you borrow to power a donation, this shows the amount to repay later. Your assets back it, so you still keep exposure.”

Card 4 — Donated to Causes  (highlight this card)
- Label: “Donated to Causes”
- Caption: “Your impact”
- Number: cumulative donations to nonprofits
- Visual: slight accent color on border or background to draw the eye without overpowering the row
- ⓘ popover text:
  “This is the total you have sent to nonprofits. Each donation appears in your receipts with a reference.”

STYLE AND BEHAVIOR
- Cards are the same size. Use clear numeric formatting with two decimals and thousand separators.
- Tooltips and popovers use the same component across all four for consistency.
- When an Effect finishes:
  - If the user ran Effect A with a typical example, update to something like:
    Cash Available ~ 500
    Invested Assets ~ 500
    Commitments ~ 400
    Donated to Causes ~ 400
  - Animate number changes. Show a toast “Portfolio updated.”
- Keep the Receipts table exactly as is below the row.

COPY RULES
- No wallet jargon. Use “account” and “portfolio”.
- Keep captions short: “Ready to allocate”, “Still growing”, “To be repaid later”, “Your impact”.

ACCESSIBILITY AND RESPONSIVENESS
- Keyboard reachable ⓘ icons. Popovers trap focus and close with Esc.
- On phones: stack as a 2x2 grid. On tablets: 4 in a row with wrap if needed.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKS
- The old “Health factor” and “Debt” cards are not visible in the summary row.
- The four new cards render with correct labels, captions, and ⓘ popovers containing the exact copy above.
- Running Effect A once updates all relevant numbers and the Receipts table, and the “Donated to Causes” card visually stands out.
- Row remains responsive and accessible.
